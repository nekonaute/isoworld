World of Isotiles
=================

WofI is a light-weight implementation for creating isometric world. It features multi-level terrains with altitude, objects and agents. The code is primarily developed as a teaching material for the coding project on artificial life "2i013, projet: Vie Artificielle", part of the bachelor in computer science at at Sorbonne Universit√© (SU). This code is an entry point to develop more complex project including dynamic environments(e.g. forest fires, ecological modifications) and species interactions (e.g. predator-prey dynamics), though you can probably develop simple games with it too.
