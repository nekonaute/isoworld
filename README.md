World of Isotiles
=================

**Wofi** is a light-weight (non-optimised) implementation for creating isometric worlds. It features multi-level terrains with altitude, objects and agents. The code is primarily developed as a teaching material for the coding project on artificial life "2i013, projet: Vie Artificielle", part of the bachelor in computer science at Sorbonne Universit√© (SU). This code is provided as an entry point to develop more complex projects including dynamic environments (e.g. forest fires, ecological changes) and species interactions (e.g. predator-prey dynamics, dynamic path planning), though you can probably develop simple games with it too.

Benchmarking
============

Method:
* (1) in the console: **python3 demo_20181119_12h45.py**
* (2) wait for at least 3 FPS updates (see console), exit (press ESC in window), then record final line with fps count (line starts with "[Quit]")

Data:
* Macbook pro, Early 2015, 3.1ghz Intel Core i7, 16 GB RAM, Intel Iris Graphics 6100: 10.272582194960501 fps (2018-11-19, Nicolas)
* Ubuntu 18.04, Intel Xeon(R) CPU E5-2609 v4 @ 1.70GHz x 16, 32 Go, Quadro K420/PCIe/SSE2: 18.57459813310919 fps (2018-11-19, Paul)

*Hint: an efficient and quite easy way to optimise running speed is to redraw only cells that have changed inbetween updates, rather than the whole world (which is the current method).*
